# Preface

As a compiler writer for domain specific cloud languages,
I became interested in compiler implementations for domain specific tensor languages
such as PyTorch 2 after the software 3.0 unlock of natural language programming from large language models such as ChatGPT.
However, I became frustrated with the *non-constructiveness* and *disjointedness* of
my learning experience in the discipline of machine learning systems —
the book that you are currently reading is my personal answer[^0] to these frustrations.

It's inspired by the introductory computer science canon created by Schemers,
which is two books masquerading as one.
[SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) and it's [dual](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffk-htdp-vs-sicp-journal/paper.pdf), [HTDP](https://htdp.org/), teach programming
and programming languages by taking readers through an unbroken logical sequence, with a [flânnerie](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/) like feel.
The recent addition of [DCIC](https://dcic-world.org/), spawning from it's phylogonetic cousin [PAPL](https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/), was created to adjust the curriculum to the recent [shift in data science](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kf-data-centric/paper.pdf) with emphasis on the *table* data structure.
This book follows suit, (*aspirationally* titled SITP),
and is an experimental CS1/CS2 for software 2.0 which takes readers from training models to developing their own deep learning frameworks — for now, the book you are about to read is still higher quality than prompting a state of the art LLM to *"write me the SICP for software 2.0"*.

If you empathize with some of my frustrations, you may benefit from the book too[^1].</br>
Good luck on your journey.</br>
Are you ready to begin?</br>
