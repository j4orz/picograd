# Preface

As a compiler writer for domain specific cloud languages,
I became interested in compiler implementations for domain specific tensor languages
such as PyTorch 2 after the software 3.0 unlock of natural language programming from large language models such as ChatGPT.
However, I became frustrated with the *non-constructiveness* and *disjointedness* of
my learning experience in the discipline of machine learning systems —
the book that you are currently reading is my personal answer[^0] to these frustrations.

It's inspired by the introductory computer science canon created by Schemers,
which is two books secretly masquerading as one.
[SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) and it's [dual](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffk-htdp-vs-sicp-journal/paper.pdf), [HTDP](https://htdp.org/), teach programming
and programming languages by taking readers through an unbroken logical sequence in a [flânnerie](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/)-like style.
The recent addition of [DCIC](https://dcic-world.org/), spawning from it's phylogonetic cousin [PAPL](https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/), was created to adjust the curriculum to the recent [shift in data science](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kf-data-centric/paper.pdf) by emphasizing the *tabular/table* data structure.
This book follows suit, (*aspirationally* titled SITP),
and is an experimental CS1/CS2 for software 2.0 which takes readers from training models to developing their own deep learning frameworks. This book has been creatively handwritten for humans, and for now, achieves such a goal better than prompting a state of the art LLM to *"write me the SICP for software 2.0"* — the number of books that comprise this style is not enough for current SOTA sample efficiency.

If you empathize with some of my frustrations, you may benefit from the book too[^1].</br>
