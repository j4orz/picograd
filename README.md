*a teaching deep learning framework: the bridge from [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) to [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad), mainted by [singularity systems research group](https://singularitysystems.bearblog.dev/)* 

The pedagogical deep learning framework made for the [SITP](https://j4orz.ai/sitp/) textbook.
Follow along with the [lectures]() and build your own deep learning framework
line by line from scratch, to run training and inference for
[nanogpt](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/).
