# teenygrad
*a teaching deep learning framework: the bridge from [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) to [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad)*

Take a whirlwind tour with the [SITP lectures and textbook](https://j4orz.ai/sitp/)
and build your own deep learning framework from scratch (a *pedagogically-omakase'd* tinygrad fork, sharing 90% of abstractions)
in order to run training and inference for [nanogpt](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/) (built in [LLM101n](https://github.com/karpathy/LLM101n)).
